## [0.1.0](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-direnv/releases/0.1.0) (2020-08-22)

- Recommend having a wrapper direnv function so that people dont have to write asdf exec direnv stuff

- Old shim is now part of asdf direnv extension command.

- You can have an .envrc with use asdf even if the directory has no .tool-versions file. All asdf current tools will be activated. In alpha

- Remove all variants of use asdf * have been removed.

  Doing use asdf will just ask asdf which versions are available in current directory.
  use asdf local/global were just internal apis and not intended for people to use.
  use asdf tool version was a bad choice since people should store versions on their .tool-versions file.

- Move commands to new asdf `lib/commands/*.bash` location
  See https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-create?id=extension-commands-for-asdf-cli

- use `asdf exec direnv` in .bashrc (#39)
