Looks like you are using the 'asdf cmd direnv _asdf_cached_envrc' command which was removed in asdf-direnv 0.3.0.

You might want to run 'asdf cmd direnv setup' again. See the README for instructions on updating.

Also, be sure to remove the old integration from '~/.config/direnv/direnvrc'. Look for a line that reads 'asdf cmd direnv hook asdf'.

The new setup command will use (and automatically manage) '~/.config/direnv/lib/use_asdf.sh' instead,
since '~/.config/direnv/direnvrc' is intended for people to manually customize.
